0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

General Learning Objectives
1. At least four different sorting algorithms
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm


General Requirements:

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, â€¦ is totally forbidden.
9. the prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
10. A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
